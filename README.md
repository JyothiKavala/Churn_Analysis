# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## Description

Telecom Customer Churn Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a telecom firm to identify patterns, understand churn drivers, and predict at-risk customers. It utilizes a complete ETL process in SQL Server to extract, transform, and load customer data, ensuring data integrity and seamless handling of recurring data loads. The dataset is then explored and cleaned to uncover key insights, which are visualized in a dynamic Power BI dashboard. The dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of customer demographics, geography, payment methods, and service usage, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

To further strengthen the analysis, a Random Forest machine learning model is developed in Python to predict customer churn. The model leverages features like customer tenure, billing information, and service preferences to forecast churn probability. This end-to-end project demonstrates how businesses can transform raw data into actionable insights, improving customer retention strategies.

The techniques and insights presented in this project are applicable across industries, making it a valuable resource for organizations aiming to optimize customer loyalty. The repository includes SQL scripts, Power BI visuals, and Python code to replicate and extend the analysis.
